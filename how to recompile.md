# Compiling guide for muchmoreballs.py or whatever it was <br/>

Download and install `pyinstaller` using **Python pip** using the following command : <br/>

```
pip install pyinstaller
```

<br/>

If using `pyinstaller` is much harder for you, consider downloading and installing `auto-py-to-exe` using the following command : <br/>

```
pip install auto-py-to-exe
```

<br/>

Then run the program using the following command : <br/>

```
auto-py-to-exe
```

<br/>

Then, choose the script file in the field script file as the file `muchmoreballs.py` or whatever it was. <br/>

Then, choose the mode to be `Console window` or `non-window` so you can properly see the balls output. <br/>

OK, when you are done, please click on that `Convert py to exe` button to begin the compiling process. <br/>

When you are done, feel free to redistribute to your friends, but be sure to keep in your mind these `pyinstaller` [limitations](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html)
